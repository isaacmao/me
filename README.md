Me
==

"Me" is a new way of Artificial Intelligence, based on my understanding of human brain and intelligence in recent years. I would expect this experiment can find a common but simple rule that regulate intelligence,which in a format of "live" system, starting from almost zero, but developing itself into different characteristics to solve problems, and engage human life. 

In this case, "Me" is the self identity of the system. It(won't be he/she in early stage) will be able to understand itself, which was mostly impossible to Turing Machine based artificial intelligence before. We can/can't prove it's possible. 

The current model starts from a "neuron" class with Python implementation. The base class will be intergrated into different modules running independently like neuron assemblies in human brain. They will communicate with each other based on the foundation of neuron mechanism.
